# Remote control speakers with IR and stepper motor
For this project I used a Vs1838b IR remote receiver, a 28BUJ-48-5V stepper
motor, a Uln2003 driver and an Arduino Nano V3. The motor shaft is connected
with a gt2 5mm pulley and another pulley is connected to the speakers
potentiometer knob. When a IR remote signal is sent from the TV remote the pulley
turns the speakers knob. That's it!
